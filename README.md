# System Administrator | Windows & Linux | RHCSA

**U.S. Citizen • Open to relocation & remote**

I design, operate, and maintain reliable Linux and Windows systems with a strong focus on uptime, security, automation, and documentation. My background includes several years working in production environments, where I supported infrastructure, automated routine operations, and ensured systems remained stable and recoverable.
